# ECCC Hourly Weather Downloader
This library allows the user to specify a weather station monitored by ECCC and carry out hourly data downloads from it. This is much more convenient than to use the default ECCC front end where you have to click through every singe day rather than download a file in bulk. 

## Requirements
The tool is written in Python and requires a batch file to execute. All parameters can be tweaked by modifying the bach file

### Virtual environment
The virtual environment required to run this tool will be provided in the future
